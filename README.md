# Random Message Generator

A codecademy projects following modules on Git, javascript syntax and css.
The project is to create a random message generator. My idea was to create the next installment of the Harry Potter series.

The project uses two arrays; one with objects and one with locations both from the harry potter world.

We then have an event listener on the button that will create a random number the same length of each array and return a title with the object and location from the arrays.

Originally the project included the openAi API to create a synopsis for the story but unfortunately ran out of tokens
